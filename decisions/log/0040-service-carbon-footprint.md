## Status

Proposal shared.
Call for consensus on Dec 18, 2024

## Context
Services are part of companies Scope 3 category 1 (Purchased goods and services). Therefore, accuracy on service carbon footprint is important. 

While the range of services that companies may purchase can vary widely, and with them the variety of calculation approaches and declared units, two main group of services have been identified as being prominent across all sectors and business models: *Desk-based services* (such as consulting, legal, and marketing services) and *IT-related services* (such as software services).

## Proposal
Proposal to include 2 additional units of measurement into the data model for accounting for service-releated emissions.

- **hour**: time in hours for Desk-based services
- **MB**: amount of data used, transferred or stored for IT-related services, as a proxy to actual emissions. 

## Rationale

- Definition:
    - Most comprehensible
- Methodology:
    - Balance between the effort and impact, i.e. SCFs are still quite lower than “good” PCFs, and therefore, it is not needed at this stage to create a full methodology

## Consequences

Forward-compatible, not backwards compatible, hence the inclusion in version 3.0.
