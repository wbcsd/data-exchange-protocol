# 22. Define OAUTH token URI endpoint for getting a token in a more flexible way allowing both "oauth" and "auth" 

Date: 2023-09-15

## Status

OPEN

## Context

Old definition prevents OUTH2 conformant solutions compliant to RFC6749 like the SAP xsuaa to work along with PACT. 
That prevented e.g. SDX from being compliant to WBCSD 1/2 in conformity check (amongst other solutions)

## Proposal

Endpoint configuration for "authentication prefix URI" must change from : "[some url]" and a fixed "auth/token" to 
"[some url]" and a fixed "/token".
e.g.

old:
https://my-authentication-endpoint/

new:
https://my-authentication-endpoint/oauth

## Decision


## Consequences

1. old conformant recipients would need to adapt their configuration for this URI (if thats relevant at all)
