# Release Instructions

Follow the instructions below to trigger a release of the Technical Specifications.

> To trigger a release, you need to have sufficient permissions on the `wbcsd` GitHub organiztion, as well as on this (`wbcsd/data-exchange-protocol`) repositiory and in the target repository [`wbcsd/tr`](https://github.com/wbcsd/tr).

> You also need to have the GitHub CLI tool locally installed and be logged in to GitHub from your local terminal. See https://cli.github.com/ for further information.

## 1. Preparation

Make sure your `specs/v2/index.bs` file is ready. In particular, you should double check if:
- The version number (`Text Macro: VERSION <x.y.z>`) contains a date (e.g. `2.2.1-20240521`). This should only be used for the work in progress version of the Technical Specifications and should not be included in any release.
- There is a changelog entry, indicating that a release is being made, and whether it is a consultation draft or a stable version.

## 2. Trigger the Release Workflow

On your command line, navigate to the `data-exchange-protocol` directory.

Use the following command to trigger the release workflow from there:
```
gh workflow run release -f version=<x.y.z>
```
Make sure to replace `<x.y.z>` by the version of the Technical Specifications being released (e.g., `2.2.1`).

With the command above, the resulting Technical Specifications will be tagged as **Stable Release**.

If instead you wish to trigger a consultation draft, pass the `draft=true` input as follows:
```
gh workflow run release -f version=<x.y.z> -f draft=true
```
The resulting document will be tagged as **Consultation Draft**.

## 3. Open a PR in the [`wbcsd/tr`](https://github.com/wbcsd/tr) Repository
