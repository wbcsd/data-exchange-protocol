## Notes on Timeline Updates
* April 2024: Release pushed from Q3 to Q4 2024 (both methodology and tech specs) given learnings in Q1 2024 requiring more time to reach consensus and alignment on all critical topics.
* June 2024: Release pushed from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 (both methodology and tech specs) given known delay in biogenic chapter and need to use the extra quarter to finalize alignment between Methodology and Technology.
* December 2024: Deprecation and Sunset dates for V2 need to be determined.
* February 2025: Removal of Sunset date, going forward we will only set a of Deprecation date to prevent confusion.
